     Dear love,

    <p id="message">
      I’ve been thinking about you a lot lately, especially during those times when I wish I could be there to pamper you, to hold you close and take care of you like you deserve, especially during those tough days. I dream of us doing all those little couple things, like watching movies, cooking together, and just being there for each other.

Every time I see couples around, I can’t help but imagine us in their place, sharing those simple moments that mean so much. I miss you more than words can say, and I can’t wait for the day we can finally be together, creating our own little world filled with love and care.

Until then, know that you’re always in my heart, and I’m here for you, no matter the distance.
