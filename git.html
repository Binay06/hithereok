				Even though the miles keep us apart, my heart feels closer to you every day. Watching you chase your dream of becoming a doctor fills me with pride and admiration. I know our love is a story that will grow with us, becoming stronger with every challenge we face.
<br><br><br>
Our journey together is like a never-ending story, one where each chapter brings us closer to the life we've always dreamed of. I believe in us, in the bond we share, and in the future we're building, no matter how far apart we may be.

I love you endlessly and can't wait for the day we can close the distance and start writing new chapters side by side.

			Love,
          	<br>Biny &#128514;
