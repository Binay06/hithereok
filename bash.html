			 I often find myself  <span class="word">daydreaming</span>  about the life we'll share together in our own little home. I can’t wait to do all the things that make a house feel like a home—cooking meals together, taking care of you when you need it, and just being there to watch all your beautiful mood swings unfold.

			 I imagine us laughing, talking, and creating memories <span class="word">in every corner of our place</span>, filling it with love and warmth. The thought of waking up next to you, sharing our lives so closely, gives me a sense of peace and happiness that I can’t put into words.
			 
			 You’re my  <span class="word">Jaanu</span> , and I look forward to every moment we’ll share together, building the life we’ve always dreamed of.and more beautiful.
			 I am committed to cherishing and loving you more with each passing day. Moving each each corner of world with you.
		 	Bye.
